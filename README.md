## Definitions

### Docker?
 <p>Docker is a tool that uses containers to make creation, deployment, and running of application a lot easier. It binds application and its dependencies inside a container.</p>

### Docker-compose?
<p>Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications. With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.</p>

### Docker VS Docker-compose

<p>The key difference between docker run versus docker-compose is that docker run is entirely command line based, while docker-compose reads configuration data from a YAML file. </p>

<p>The second major difference is that docker run can only start one container at a time, while docker-compose will configure and run multiple.</p>

### Docker VS Virtual Machine

![My animated logo](images/docker_vs_vm.png)

<p>As you can see each virtual machine has its guest operating system above the host operating system, which makes virtual machines heavy. While on the other hand, Docker containers share the host operating system, and that is why they are lightweight. </p>

<p>Here is a table which concludes on a virtual machine and Docker container differences.</p>
